1. **Function of the Servo library**:
   The `Servo` library is used to control servo motors. In the code, it is included with the line `#include <Servo.h>`, and an instance of the `Servo` class is created with `Servo myservo;`. The library allows you to control the position of a servo motor by sending it the desired angle.

2. **Function of the map() function**:
   In the code, the `map()` function is used to convert the analog input value from the potentiometer to a range of angles that the servo motor can move. The `map()` function takes five arguments: the value to be mapped, the current value range (0 to 1023 for analog input), and the target value range (0 to 180 for servo angles). It linearly scales the input value from one range to another.

3. **Purpose of the delay() function**:
   The `delay(15)` function is used to introduce a small delay in the loop. This delay is 15 milliseconds. It's commonly used to slow down the servo's movement and prevent it from rapidly changing positions. Without this delay, the servo may move too quickly and might not provide a smooth or controlled motion.

4. **Required components for the project**:
   Based on the code and the provided information, it appears that the required components for the project include:
   - An Arduino Uno board.
   - A potentiometer (for controlling the servo).
   - A servo motor.
   - Necessary wires to make the electrical connections.
   - A power source for the Arduino board and the servo (usually via USB for the Arduino Uno).
   
   Additionally, it's assumed that you have the necessary hardware (e.g., a computer) to upload and run the code on the Arduino Uno board.

This project sets up a simple system where the servo motor's position is controlled by the potentiometer's analog input, allowing you to change the servo's angle by turning the potentiometer. The map() function is used to convert the analog reading to a suitable servo angle, and the delay() function is used to slow down the servo's response for smoother motion.
