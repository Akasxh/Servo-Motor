**Q: I'm encountering challenges in achieving servo motor responsiveness to the potentiometer. What could be the underlying causes?**

A: Several factors may contribute to the issue you're facing. Firstly, it's imperative to verify the correctness of the wiring and the security of all connections. Ensure that the power and ground pins for both the potentiometer and servo motor are correctly connected to the corresponding pins on the Arduino Uno. Additionally, a critical check should be conducted to confirm that the control pin of the servo motor is appropriately linked to digital pin 9 of the Arduino Uno.

If the wiring is confirmed to be accurate, the next step is scrutinizing the code for potential errors. Thoroughly review the code for typos or syntax errors. Likewise, confirm the correct inclusion of the requisite libraries within the code, ensuring that they are accurately spelled. A meticulous examination should also be made of the JSON code pertaining to the project. Carefully inspect the formatting and the positioning of brackets to ensure accuracy.

**Q: I'm utilizing the Wokwi website for project simulation, yet the servo motor does not seem to respond to the potentiometer input. What are the possible causes for this discrepancy?**

A: In instances where both the wiring and code are verified to be accurate, it's conceivable that the issue may be linked to the performance of the Wokwi website itself. Consider reloading the webpage or clearing your browser's cache. Should the issue persist, consider experimenting with an alternative web browser or device as a potential solution for accessing the website.

**Q: I have copied and pasted the JSON code for the project, but it appears to be non-functional. What steps should be taken in this situation?**

A: An essential starting point is to conduct a meticulous examination of the pasted JSON code, with a focus on verifying that the code is accurately positioned and that bracket placement and formatting are correct. It is also critical to review the code for any possible syntax errors or typographical discrepancies. If the issue continues to persist, consider refreshing the webpage or clearing the browser's cache. In cases where the problem remains unresolved, contemplate utilizing an alternative web browser or device to access the website.
